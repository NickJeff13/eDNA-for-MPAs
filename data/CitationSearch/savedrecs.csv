Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a promising alternative for marine ecosystem monitoring, but more direct comparisons to visual surveys are needed to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach. This study compares fish communities inside and outside the Scorpion State Marine Reserve off Santa Cruz Island, CA using eDNA metabarcoding and underwater visual census surveys. Results from eDNA captured 76% (19/25) of fish species and 95% (19/20) of fish genera observed during pairwise underwater visual census. Species missed by eDNA were due to the inability of MiFish 12S barcodes to differentiate species of rockfishes (Sebastes, n = 4) or low site occupancy rates of crevice-dwelling Lythrypnus gobies. However, eDNA detected an additional 23 fish species not recorded in paired visual surveys, but previously reported from prior visual surveys, highlighting the sensitivity of eDNA. Significant variation in eDNA signatures by location (50 m) and site (similar to 1000 m) demonstrates the sensitivity of eDNA to address key questions such as community composition inside and outside MPAs. Results demonstrate the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for monitoring marine ecosystems, providing an important complementary tool to visual methods.",,,,,"Gold, Zachary/KBA-8921-2024","Gold, Zachary/0000-0003-0490-7630",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,FEB 24,2021,16,2,,,,,,,e0238557,10.1371/journal.pone.0238557,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238557,,,,,,,,33626067,,,,,WOS:000623658100013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Traditional monitoring methods often rely on visual and/or acoustic detections from vessels and aircraft, but limitations including cost, errors in the detection of some species and dependence on taxonomic expertise, as well as good weather and visibility conditions often limit the temporal and spatial scale of effective, long-term monitoring programs. In recent years, environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a revolutionary tool for cost-effective, sensitive, non-invasive species monitoring in both terrestrial and aquatic realms. eDNA is a rapidly developing field and a growing number of studies have successfully implemented this approach for the detection and identification of marine mammals. Here, we review 21 studies published between 2012 and 2021 that employed eDNA for marine mammal monitoring including single species detection, biodiversity assessment and genetic characterization. eDNA has successfully been used to infer species presence (especially useful for rare, elusive or threatened species) and to characterize the population genetic structure, although additional research is needed to support the interpretation of non-detections.

The establishment of a network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can help restrict damaging activities and have been recognised as a potential solution to aid marine conservation. When managed correctly they can deliver both ecological and socio-economic benefits. In recent times, MPA designations have increased rapidly while many countries have set future MPA targets for the decades ahead. An integral element of MPA management is adequate monitoring that collects data to assess if conservation objectives are being achieved. Data acquired by monitoring can vary widely as can the techniques employed to collect such data. Ideally, non-destructive and non-invasive methods are preferred to prevent damage to habitats and species, though this may rule out a number of traditional extractive sampling approaches such as dredges and trawls. Moreover, advances in ocean observation technologies enable the collection of large amounts of data at high resolutions, while automated data processing is beginning to make analyses more logistically feasible and less time-consuming. Therefore, developments to existing marine monitoring techniques and new emerging technologies have led to a diverse array of options when choosing to implement an MPA monitoring programme. Here, we present a review of new and existing non-extractive techniques which can be applied to MPA monitoring. We summarise their capabilities, applications, advantages, limitations and possible future developments.

Most traditional census methods are demanding or destructive. Nondisturbing and nonlethal approaches based on video and environmental DNA are alternatives to underwater visual census or fishing. However, their ability to detect multiple biodiversity factors beyond traditional taxonomic diversity is still unknown. For bony fishes and elasmobranchs, we compared the performance of eDNA metabarcoding and long-term remote video to assess species' phylogenetic and functional diversity. We used 10 eDNA samples from 30 L of water each and 25 hr of underwater videos over 4 days on Malpelo Island (pacific coast of Colombia), a remote marine protected area. Metabarcoding of eDNA detected 66% more molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) than species on video. We found 66 and 43 functional entities with a single eDNA marker and videos, respectively, and higher functional richness for eDNA than videos. Despite gaps in genetic reference databases, eDNA also detected a higher fish phylogenetic diversity than videos; accumulation curves showed how 1 eDNA transect detected as much phylogenetic diversity as 25 hr of video. Environmental DNA metabarcoding can be used to affordably, efficiently, and accurately census biodiversity factors in marine systems.

Connectivity and representativity are essential factors that underlie successful implementation of MPA networks, which can safeguard biological diversity and ecosystem function, and ultimately support the blue economy strategy by balancing ocean use with conservation. New big data omics approaches, including genomics and transcriptomics, are becoming essential tools for the development and maintenance of MPA networks. Current molecular omics techniques, including population-scale genome sequencing, have direct applications for assessing population connectivity and for evaluating how genetic variation is represented within and among MPAs. Effective baseline characterization and long-term, scalable, and comprehensive monitoring are essential for successful MPA management, and omics approaches hold great promise to characterize the full range of marine life, spanning the microbiome to megafauna across a range of environmental conditions (shallow sea to the deep ocean). Omics tools, such as eDNA metabarcoding can provide a cost-effective basis for biodiversity monitoring in large and remote conservation areas. Here we provide an overview of current omics applications for conservation planning and monitoring, with a focus on metabarcoding, metagenomics, and population genomics. Emerging approaches, including whole-genome sequencing, characterization of genomic architecture, epigenomics, and genomic vulnerability to climate change are also reviewed.

A key question is how do we collect relevant data on biodiversity and population trends to inform their design and measure success? This question is particularly relevant for marine taxa that are difficult to survey, such as sharks and rays, and where populations may occur over vast areas. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has proven to be an effective sampling method and may provide a solution to these challenges; however, it remains unclear how its sampling effectiveness compares with traditionally used methods for elasmobranch surveying. Here, we directly compared the efficacy of eDNA metabarcoding and demersal longline deployments to survey elasmobranchs across 31 sites over a 55,000 km2 area of the Kimberley and Roebuck Australian Marine Parks in Australia's North-west Marine Parks Network. In total, we documented 49 unique elasmobranch taxa, 36 of which were detected by eDNA and 32 (from a total of 815 captured sharks) by longline. A combined approach yielded over 34% more elasmobranch taxa than either method alone. Site community compositions varied between the two survey methods; notably eDNA was able to detect species from outside of the immediate sampling area, although this was still consistent with a detection radius of a few kilometres, highlighting a particular use in rugose reef habitats where it is difficult to deploy longlines. In investigating the quantitative use of eDNA data, we report that eDNA metabarcoding read abundance (count) data was poorly correlated with longline aggregate catch (count and biomass) data across raw, relative and rank abundance measures. However, we found that in multivariate analyses, both binary (presence-absence) and abundance (after square-root transformation) datasets produced highly similar ordination patterns, largely segregating method (eDNA vs. longline), followed by latitude and depth. Lastly, we identified required levels of eDNA replication and longline deployments to maximize captured elasmobranch diversity. This study sets an integrated, georeferenced baseline and long-term monitoring approach for the management and conservation of elasmobranch diversity within this unique marine park network.",,,,,"Harry, Alastair/A-3370-2011; Travers, Michael/F-7765-2011; Harvey, Euan/B-2896-2011","Travers, Michael/0000-0002-3072-1699; Harvey, Euan/0000-0002-9069-4581; West, Katrina/0000-0002-9026-5058",,,,,,,,,,,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,APR,2024,34,4,,,,,,,e4144,10.1002/aqc.4144,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.4144,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001195433300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most studies assess conservation effectiveness solely in terms of taxonomic diversity, without delving into the contributions of functional and phylogenetic diversity. In this study, we used environmental DNA combined with multifaceted diversity indicators to assess the impact of the level of protection on the fish community in Hong Kong waters. Our results indicated that the marine protected areas significantly contributed to fish community conservation. The no-take marine reserve exhibited the highest taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, while partially protected marine parks showed the most balanced community composition. No significant increase in fish functional diversity was found in the protected areas. Water quality, hydrological condition, and protection level were the primary factors affecting community variation for taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity, respectively.

To mitigate these losses, information on their distribution and community composition is needed. Monitoring these (often) mobile species is challenging, especially in remote, highly dynamic and turbid coastal areas. Here, we use an environmental DNA (eDNA) approach to: (1) establish the presence and distribution of elasmobranch species, (2) compare this to a conventional fisheries-dependent approach, and (3) determine the influence of season, area-based protection and habitat on elasmobranch community composition in the highly dynamic Bijag & PRIME;os Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau (West Africa). We collected 127 seawater samples and detected elasmobranch DNA in 58 (45.7%) of these samples, confirming the presence of 13 different elasmobranch species (2 sharks, 11 rays), including seven threatened species. Eight of the species detected by the eDNA-approach were also recorded in a fisheries observer program, which recorded another eight species not detected by the eDNA approach. The most commonly occurring species, based on the number of eDNA sampling locations were the pearl whipray (Fontitrygon margaritella), smalltooth stingray (Hypanus rudis), scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini), and the blackchin guitarfish (Glaucostegus cemiculus). Species composition and richness differed significantly before (January-March) and after the rainy season (November-December). Furthermore, we showed that community composition and species richness did not differ between protected (MPA) and non-protected areas of the archipelago.

Strictly no-take MPAs, also called marine reserves, undeniably promote fish biomass and density, but it remains unclear how biodiversity responds to protection. Identifying which facets of biodiversity respond to protection is critical for the management of MPAs and the development of relevant conservation strategies towards the achievement of biodiversity targets. We collected 99 environmental DNA (eDNA) samples inside and outside nine marine reserves in the Mediterranean Sea to assess the effect of protection on 11 biodiversity indicators based on fish traits, phylogeny and vulnerability to fishing. We controlled for the effect of environmental heterogeneity (habitat, bathymetry, productivity, temperature and accessibility) using a principal component analysis, and for spatial autocorrelation due to potential unmeasured factors. We found a positive and significant effect of protection on only 3 out of 11 indicators: functional and phylogenic diversity but also the ratio between demerso-pelagic and benthic species richness. Rather, total fish richness responded significantly and negatively to protection. We did not detect any significant effect of protection on threatened and elasmobranch species richness, probably due to their large home range compared to the size of Mediterranean marine reserves. Synthesis and applications: Our findings highlight the importance of looking beyond the mere number of species to fully depict and understand the effect of marine reserves on biodiversity and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures. Rather, we propose a dashboard of three eDNA-based indicators that can provide an early signal of ecosystem deterioration or recovery. eDNA metabarcoding offers a powerful tool to supply site-specific and standardized taxonomic-, phylogenetic- and trait-based biodiversity assessments, in complement to other classical techniques, such as visual censuses or video surveys, able to estimate species abundance but also individual life-stage and size.",,,,,"Marques, Virginie/AAE-1507-2020; Pichot, Franck/JNS-9947-2023; Lenfant, Philippe/D-3908-2009; Dalongeville, Alicia/ABG-5045-2020; Mouillot, David/HCH-5670-2022","Boissery, Pierre/0000-0003-3849-9487; velez, laure/0000-0001-9555-6770; Boulanger, Emilie/0000-0002-6446-7342; Marques, Virginie/0000-0002-5142-4191; ARNAL, VERONIQUE/0000-0002-4037-490X; Pichot, Franck/0009-0003-2674-8359",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,NOV,2022,59,11,,,,,2803,2813,,10.1111/1365-2664.14276,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14276,,SEP 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000855968900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their population status is often poorly understood due to insufficient information. Despite reportedly harbouring critical elasmobranch habitats, the Banc d'Arguin National Park (PNBA) in Mauritania lacks comprehensive and updated information on the diversity of elasmobranch species in the area. We developed a baseline inventory based on morphological and molecular identification and metabarcoding. DNA barcoding of tissue samples from elasmobranch processing sites and freshly sampled specimens was used to build a genetic reference database of local elasmobranch species. The richness and diversity of species in the PNBA were described via metabarcoding of seawater eDNA samples using an elasmobranch-specific assay and our reference database. We detected 27 species, including 12 new species records for the PNBA. We further uncover potentially undescribed species of Gymnura and Torpedo, while taxonomic corrections are noted for previously reported species. In particular, the reportedly abundant Mustelus mustelus was absent from tissue and eDNA samples, while M. punctulatus was detected instead. Taxa that have anecdotally become regionally extinct or rare (e.g., sawfishes, wedgefishes, lemon sharks) were not detected, highlighting local species diversity shifts within the last few decades. Results show that 67.9% of elasmobranch species in the PNBA are threatened with extinction according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Water samples were collected above coral reefs, seagrass meadows, estuarine sites and open water in the Northern Koh Kong region and the Koh Rong Archipelago, a marine national park. A region of the 12S rDNA was targeted for fish diversity. Additionally, for the detection of marine mammals, 16S ribosomal DNA was amplified.

Functional diversity analyses categorized species into 18 distinct functional groups, shedding light on their ecological roles within the investigated habitats. Comparison with existing fish surveys and databases highlighted the effectiveness of eDNA metabarcoding in providing comparable or better biodiversity estimates. The study also identified two marine mammal species, including the endangered Irrawaddy dolphin, emphasizing the importance of eDNA in detecting elusive and threatened species.

The outputs of this approach are, therefore, crucial to provide data for conservation priorities and to support fisheries management. We conducted a study using eDNA metabarcoding to understand the distribution of marine biodiversity across Indonesia and to investigate the abundance of three major phyla that comprise a majority of marine biodiversity. In this study, a total of 13,819,634 reads corresponding to 23,252 unique sequences belonging to the phyla Chordata, Mollusca, and Echinodermata were generated from COI amplicons obtained from 92 seawater eDNA samples collected from nine locations and 17 sites. Beta diversity differed significantly across locations (PERMANOVA: p < 0.05) based on Bray-Curtis and Jaccard indices. Taxa of interest were not distributed equally and there were no discernible patterns detected across the sampling area. This might be due to the highly variable percentage of sequenced species between families, preventing robust estimation of species richness. Overall, 45% of reads were identified to species level while 55% were classified as unidentified taxa. Interestingly, the percentage of unidentified taxa was similar between two locations with distinct characteristics representing eastern and western extremities of the sampling region. Despite a relatively poor rate of assignment to species level, our results highlight unprecedented levels of marine biodiversity and strong differences in species composition. This further supports the contention that the eDNA approach is a sensitive method that can provide useful data, in particular to detect changes in species composition. Importantly, this method is clearly advantageous to evaluate marine biodiversity on a large scale and can provide data to support region-wide coral reef management strategies. Knowing species diversity and the degree to which various taxa are distributed is a fundamental for advancing our knowledge of marine ecology and can play an important role in forecasting population dynamics and evolution as well as in refining conservation practices.",,,,,"subhan, beginer/JAX-1707-2023; AKBAR, NEBUCHADNEZZAR/ACK-6567-2022; Jefri, Edwin/HGE-3116-2022; Cahyani, Ni Kadek Dita/AAC-3766-2019; Madduppa, Hawis/ABD-7468-2021; Bengen, Dietriech/AAK-6008-2020","Jefri, Edwin/0000-0001-7351-3913; Akbar, Nebuchadnezzar/0000-0001-9528-4672; Arafat, Dondy/0000-0002-0100-9213; Subhan, Beginer/0000-0002-2179-0721; Cahyani, Ni Kadek Dita/0000-0003-4484-6414; Sani, Lalu M Iqbal/0000-0001-5757-6113; Madduppa, Hawis/0000-0003-4260-5625",,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,,,SEP,2021,30,11,,,,,3087,3114,,10.1007/s10531-021-02237-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-021-02237-0,,JUL 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000671635500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

These methods are widely seen as the future of biodiversity monitoring, but they have yet to become established as routine monitoring techniques for elasmobranch species. Here, we developed species-specific quantitative PCR assays for the detection of grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) and silvertip shark (Carcharhinus albimarginatus). We assessed whether species-specific eDNA methods could infer the distribution of the two species around the atolls of the Chagos Archipelago, which, despite being surrounded by a large marine protected area, experience contrasting levels of illegal fishing leading to heterogeneity in shark population densities. We found that eDNA detections were significantly reduced and sporadic around the northern atolls, which are under high pressure from illegal fishing. By contrast eDNA detections of both species were ubiquitous and consistent around the highly protected atoll Diego Garcia. We postulate that current levels of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is having a significant impact on the shark community in the northern atolls and suppressing local reef shark populations. In the northern atolls we also employed visual and acoustic telemetry techniques to reveal the distribution of reef sharks. We found that despite eDNA samples being taken directly after visual surveys, detection results did not correlate, suggesting a need for further optimisation of eDNA methods for detecting sharks. However, both species were detected by eDNA in sites where they were not observed, highlighting that the scale of the sampling environment must be considered when inferring eDNA results and showing that eDNA methods can be used to fill gaps in data from more established monitoring techniques.

There were no significant differences between habitats in terms of taxonomic and functional diversity, but a higher taxonomic diversity was detected using eDNA. Both methods were able to distinguish fish assemblages between different habitats; however, gillnet surveys performed better than eDNA surveys for distinguishing mangrove from seagrass assemblages.

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been established worldwide to preserve these communities, while mesophotic ecosystems could provide natural refugia. Assessing the extent to which MPAs and deeper ecosystems can mitigate human and climate change impacts requires regular monitoring of temporal community dynamics. Environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys - being time- and cost-effective - can provide valuable insights on biodiversity change. Here, we initiated a long-term study based on eDNA monitoring in an MPA in the north-western Mediterranean Sea that includes areas with various protection levels. Specifically, from June 2021 to January 2023, we collected eDNA samples during the summer, fall, and winter seasons from shallow water (20 m depth), at 40 m depth, and from the mesophotic zone (80 m depth) in a Fully Protected Area (FPA) and in a nearby Lightly Protected Area (LPA) in the Riou archipelago (France). In this short period and relatively small area, we detected a total of 113 actinopterygian and chondrichthyan taxa. Species with high fishing vulnerability had higher detection rates in the FPA than in the LPA, suggesting a positive impact of FPAs on the conservation of these threatened species. A marked seasonal signal in species detections, including significantly lower detections of several species in winter, indicated a combined effect of species biological changes and migration behavior. The seasonality trend was stronger in the FPA than in the LPA, indicating that such areas may modify sub-yearly patterns in communities and ecosystem processes. Fish composition was associated with water depth, with marked species dissimilarities between shallow waters and the mesophotic zone, implying that multiple depths should be considered in MPA monitoring to fully capture the response of biodiversity to management.

There were no differences in fish communities based on the presence and absence of ASVs between sample depth (surface and 40 m) or sampling habitat, but communities based on read abundance were significantly different between habitats. The dominant elasmobranch species were grey reef (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) and silvertip (C. albimarginatus) sharks, and elasmobranch communities were significantly different between sampling depth and habitat. Overall, we find that eDNA metabarcoding can be used to reveal the diversity of elasmobranchs within broader taxonomic assays, but further research and development of targeted metabarcoding primers may be required before it can be integrated into a toolkit for monitoring these species.",,,,,"Dunn, Nicholas/AAT-8199-2020; Andrzejaczek, Samantha/Q-7613-2018","Curnick, David/0000-0002-3093-1282; Dunn, Nicholas/0000-0002-6231-5222; Savolainen, Vincent/0000-0001-5350-9984; Carbone, Chris/0000-0002-9253-3765; Weber, Sam/0000-0003-1447-4082; Andrzejaczek, Samantha/0000-0002-9929-7312",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-4082,1096-3642,,,,OCT 7,2022,196,2,,,,,593,607,,10.1093/zoolinnean/zlac014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlac014,,APR 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000787042000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Successful application of MPAs will be predicated on the ability to monitor biodiversity in a synoptic and noninvasive manner. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods have important advantages over traditional biodiversity survey methods for monitoring conservation areas. To evaluate the efficacy of eDNA metabarcoding for fish biodiversity monitoring, we sampled 19 coastal eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds in Canada, as eelgrass beds are known for high biodiversity and significant conservation value. At each site, beach seines were used to survey fish and water samples were collected contemporaneously for eDNA metabarcoding. In total, beach seining caught 32 672 individuals across 59 fish taxa, and eDNA detected 129 fish taxa. eDNA captured site-level variation and detected higher species richness at both site and regional levels compared to seining. eDNA abundance had a positive association with capture abundance.

Transforming natural coastlines into urban seascapes through habitat artificialization may result in loss of biodiversity and key ecosystem functions. Yet, the extent to which seaports differ from nearby natural habitats and marine reserves across the whole Tree of Life is still unknown. This study aimed to assess the level of alpha and beta-diversity between seaports and reserves, and whether these biodiversity patterns are conserved across taxa and evolutionary lineages. For that, we used environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to survey six seaports on the French Mediterranean coast and four strictly no-take marine reserves nearby. By targeting four different groups-prokaryotes, eukaryotes, metazoans and fish-with appropriate markers, we provide a holistic view of biodiversity on contrasted habitats. In the absence of comprehensive reference databases, we used bioinformatic pipelines to gather similar sequences into molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs). In contrast to our expectations, we obtained no difference in MOTU richness (alpha-diversity) between habitats except for prokaryotes and threatened fishes with higher diversity in reserves than in seaports. However, we observed a marked dissimilarity (beta-diversity) between seaports and reserves for all taxa. Surprisingly, this biodiversity signature of seaports was preserved across the Tree of Life, up to the order. This result reveals that seaports and nearby marine reserves share few taxa and evolutionary lineages along urbanized coasts and suggests major differences in terms of ecosystem functioning between both habitats.",,,,,"Macé, Bastien/HHZ-0590-2022; Mouillot, David/HCH-5670-2022; Dalongeville, Alicia/ABG-5045-2020","Varenne, Alix/0000-0003-3850-7969; Mace, Bastien/0000-0001-7721-3993",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,JUN,2024,33,12,,,,,,,,10.1111/mec.17373,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.17373,,MAY 2024,,,,,,38703047,,,,,WOS:001214231200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a major tool for biodiversity conservation at sea. Monitoring of both species and habitat diversity in MPAs is therefore mandatory and must include both inventory and periodic surveillance activities. In the case of inventories, the ideal would be to census all species and all habitats, but while the latter goal can be within reach, the former seems unattainable. Species inventory should be commeasured to investigation effort, while habitat inventory should be based on mapping. Both inventories may profit from suitability spatial modelling. Periodic surveillance actions should privilege conspicuous species and priority habitats. Efficient descriptor taxa and ecological indices are recommended to evaluate environmental status.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the community structure of coral fish from three different marine protected area reef zones (utility zone, open access zone, core zone) around Lombok Island using eDNA metabarcoding. Biological community composition, richness, and diversity were evaluated based on reads from mid-column water and sediment samples. A total of 58 species were identified from the eDNA samples using the Multiplex Barcode Research And Visualization Environment (mBRAVE) pipeline. The Shannon-Wiener index (H') showed significantly higher species diversity in the core zone than the utility and open access zones. There was no significant between-zone difference in community structure (ANOSIM, R = 0.11 < 0.25). NMDS analysis using the Bray-Curtis test showed significant between-zone differences in species diversity and abundance (PERMANOVA Adonis Pr (> F) = 0.001, p < 0.05).

The box (OCD; open-close device) was equipped with an actuator that attached to hinged doors at both ends, enabling it to be opened and closed remotely at depths up to 6000 m through preexisting communications, thereby exposing the internal chamber to the surrounding water upon activation. A sterile active carbon sponge was inserted into the internal chamber for eDNA capture during each deployment. The OCD sampler was field tested during a voyage to the Gascoyne Marine Park region off northwest Australia. We compared three different methods for processing the captured eDNA from the sampler: filtering OCD water, extracting eDNA from sponge pieces, and filtering sponge rinse water. Using fish as our example organism, we also compared the identities of fishes from eDNA detections with bottom trawl survey data collected during the same survey, and the known regional species pool, to confirm the eDNA identifications were plausible. A large number of fishes (193 taxa, from 87 families) were detected, and the majority were found within their expected depth ranges (> 75%), and in the trawl catches (60%).

Monitoring of demersal and benthic fish communities is often based on invasive methods like bottom trawling, however in some cases less invasive methods might be available. The need for developing alternative and less invasive monitoring methods is supported by an increasing number of Marine Protected Areas and Windfarms where traditional methods such as trawls cannot be deployed due to conservational or technical and safety reasons. To support the development of new monitoring concepts, we conducted a literature review to identify limits and opportunities of methods that are already available. Furthermore, we present a fit-for purpose guide that can help identifying the appropriate method for individual purposes. We defined eight different methods which were analyzed using four different criteria and listed their advantages and disadvantages. We further apply this guide to monitoring in Marine Protected Areas in the Baltic Sea as a case study, indicating that besides traditional bottom trawling, alternative and less invasive methods could be sufficient for specific research purposes.

Estuaries are key habitats subject to multiple anthropogenic and natural stressors. Due to these multiple stressors, the detection of anthropogenic pressure is challenging. The fact that abundant natural stressors often lead to negative quality assessments has been coined the estuarine quality paradox. To solve this issue, the application of molecular approaches with successful bioindicators like foraminifera is promising. However, sampling protocols, molecular procedures and data analyses need to be validated before such tools can be routinely applied. We conducted an environmental DNA survey of estuarine mudflats along the French Atlantic coast, using a metabarcoding approach targeting foraminifera. Our results demonstrate that estuarine environments have only a few active OTUs dominating the community composition and a large stock of dormant or propagule stages. This last genetic diversity components constitute an important reservoir, with different species which can potentially develop in response to the temporal variability of the multiple stressors. In fact, different OTUs were dominant in the studied estuaries. Our statistical model shows that the physical and chemical characteristics of the sediment and the climatic conditions explain only 43 % of the community composition variance. This suggests that other, less easily quantifiable factors, such as the history and use of the estuaries or the ecological drift could play an important role as well.

These fish use coastal marine ecosystems as nursery areas, but also to forage and to avoid predation or competition. We studied spatial, seasonal, lunar and diel variations in a coastal fish community from a marine protected area of the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau. Fish were sampled with 46 beach seine net sessions in 2015 and 2016. A total of 35 fish species of 25 families were captured. Fish abundance varied between years and seasons, with a higher abundance in the dry season, but not by lunar tide. Nonetheless, the community composition was broadly similar over the seasons, among islands and between lunar tides. Clupeidae, Haemulidae and Gerreidae were the most abundant fish families. Sardinella maderensis highly dominated the captures throughout the year, with catches much higher than any other species. The differences in abundance between seasons and years may be related with movements to or from the shore due to feeding activity or to avoid predation, or else to differences in recruitment between years. There were no significant diel differences in species richness and diversity, although higher numbers of fish were captured during daytime. For most species the majority of individuals captured were immature, highlighting the importance of the archipelago as nursery area for several species. These small pelagics, and particularly Sardinella maderensis, represent the main prey for several marine predators.

While many of these species have shown signs of population decline, the size-selective nature of fishing generally impacts population size structure before population declines are evident. However, long-term size-specific information, especially for the largest size classes, is rare. Our ability to gain an early warning of fishery overexploitation is thus limited. We developed the Western Outdoor News (WON) database, which consists of a long-term (1966-2013) time series of trophy-sized fishes caught along the California coast and Baja California, Mexico. Sixteen demersal species, with a total of 25 943 records, were the focus of this study. Twelve of the 16 species showed signs of long-term decline in trophy size, but 9 of these 12 showed signs of transition to either stabilization or initial recovery in the most recent years. The more progressive state fisheries management actions adopted since 2001 have likely contributed to this apparent shift in trends, and the new coastal marine protected area (MPA) networks may benefit these populations even more in the future. Trophy size increased with distance from home port, and the distance required to reach maximum trophy sizes increased over time, especially for the rockfishes, which suggests that declines were due to overfishing. Trophy sizes of fishes caught specifically within the Northern Channel Islands region showed long-term declines through the early 2000s, but also showed signs of stabilization or initial recovery for some species since the 2003 implementation of the Northern Channel Islands network of MPAs.",,,,,,"Bellquist, Lyall/0000-0003-1247-0483",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,APR 7,2016,547,,,,,,1,18,,10.3354/meps11667,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps11667,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000374241200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, validation of the usefulness of DNA recovered from sponges to reveal vertebrate biodiversity patterns in Marine Protected Areas is still needed. Additionally, nothing is known about how different sponge species and morphologies influence the capture of environmental DNA and whether biodiversity patterns obtained from sponges are best described by quantitative or qualitative measures. In this study, we amplified and sequenced a vertebrate specific 12S barcode with a set of universal PCR primers (MiFish) for metabarcoding environmental DNA from fishes, to unveil fine-scale patterns of fish communities from natural-sampler DNA retrieved from 64 sponges (16 species) located in eutrophic and well-preserved coral reefs in Nha Trang Bay (central Vietnam). Ninety tropical fish species were identified from the sponges, corresponding to one third of the total local ichthyofauna reported from previous extensive conventional surveys. Significant differentiation in fish communities between eutrophic and well-preserved environments was observed, albeit eutrophication only explained a modest proportion of the variation between fish communities. Differences in efficiency of capturing fish environmental DNA among sponge species or morphologies were not observed. Overall, the majority of detected fish species corresponded to reef-associated small-sized species, as expected in coral reefs environments. Remarkably, pelagic, migratory, and deep-sea fish species were also recovered from sponge tissues, pointing out the ability of sponge natural sampled DNA to detect fishes that were not permanently associated to the biomes where the sponges were sampled.

Purple urchins were less dense and more cryptic inside a local marine protected area (MPA) that contained high predator abundance than in nearby heavily fished areas, whereas red urchins rarely were found outside the MPA. Urchin proportional mortality was inversely density dependent during the day when sheephead were active, despite fish aggregations in plots of high urchin density, but was density independent during the night when lobsters were active. Urchin mortality was reduced under understory algal cover during the day, but not during the night.

This review delves into the ecological significance of marine top predators, examining their roles in maintaining ecosystem stability and functioning through an integrated analysis of current scientific literature. We first assess the efficacy of various monitoring methods, ranging from traditional field observations to cutting-edge technologies like satellite tracking and environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis and evaluating their strengths and limitations in terms of accuracy, spatial coverage, and cost-effectiveness, providing resource managers with essential insights for informed decision-making. Then, by synthesizing data from diverse marine ecosystems, this study offers a comprehensive overview of the trends affecting top predator populations worldwide. We explore the multifaceted impacts of human activities, climate change, and habitat degradation on the abundance and distribution of these key species. In doing so, we shed light on the broader implications of declining top predator populations, such as trophic cascades and altered community structures. Following a thorough assessment of successful strategies for reversing the decline of top predators, a compilation of recommendations is presented, encompassing effective governance interventions. A crucial aspect of effective ecosystem-based management is the implementation of robust monitoring strategies. Mitigation measures are imperative to reverse the adverse impacts on marine top predators. We present a comprehensive array of mitigation options based on successful case studies. These include the establishment of marine protected areas, the enforcement of fisheries regulations, and the promotion of sustainable fishing practices. We deepen the synergies between these strategies and their potential to mitigate human-induced stressors on top predator populations to safeguard their pivotal role in maintaining marine ecosystem structure and function. By examining marine top predators' ecological significance, analyzing population trends, discussing monitoring techniques, and outlining effective mitigation strategies, we provide a comprehensive resource for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders engaged in fostering ecosystem-based management approaches.

J,"Archana, A; Baker, DM",,,,"Archana, Anand; Baker, David Michael",,,Multifunctionality of an Urbanized Coastal Marine Ecosystem,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Coastal marine ecosystems provide numerous invaluable services and benefits to humankind. However, urbanization of coastal areas has homogenized and reduced the biodiversity of the surrounding marine environment and the sustainability of the multiple ecosystem services it provides. Studies have focused on single ecosystem functions despite human populations relying on several functions being delivered at once (known as multifunctionality). This study investigates five ecosystem functions (primary productivity, herbivory, predation, organic matter decomposition and carbon sequestration) and overall multifunctionality in four sites along a gradient of 16 environmental parameters. Ecosystem function varied significantly between sites that were farthest apart. In determining factors that drove ecosystem functioning, we found a positive relationship between coral cover and primary productivity but negative relationships between coral cover and levels of herbivory and predation intensity. Higher temperatures and greater concentrations of chlorophyll-a had a positive impact on predation and herbivory, respectively. Notably, we found a significant negative impact of total inorganic nitrogen and significant positive impact of total Kjeldahl nitrogen on carbon sequestration. Further, individual functions were compared with fish abundance (obtained from seawater eDNA), and benthic community composition (obtained from plate % coverage of autonomous reef monitoring structures). Increasing herbivorous fish abundance had a positive impact on Ulva mass loss. Overall, relative abundance of predatory, omnivorous and planktivorous fish exerted overriding influences on primary productivity and predation intensity, implying that fishing pressure and marine protected area status are important factors. Importantly, we found significant effects from environmental parameters indicating that reliably predicting the effects of future anthropogenic impacts will not be straightforward as multiple drivers are likely to have complex effects. Taken together, urbanized coastal ecosystems exhibit varying levels of multifunctionality depending on the extent of human impact, and the functional diversity of the benthic community present.",,,,,"Baker, David/B-2512-2010","Baker, David/0000-0002-0308-4954",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,DEC 3,2020,7,,,,,,,,557145,10.3389/fmars.2020.557145,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.557145,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000598222100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given the threats posed by fishing, marine reserves (MRs) present a promising option.Ata Whenua (Fiordland) in the South Island of Aotearoa/New Zealand is an ideal location to investigate this phenomenon owing to the presence of several shark species in coastal MRs.One-hundred and sixty-seven baited remote underwater video deployments were made in five MRs. A multi-model inference approach using generalized linear modelling was used to assess the combined effect of the MRs on two trophic groups of coastal sharks.Generalized linear modelling was used to assess the effect of protection on, firstly, the presence of broadnose sevengill sharks (Notorynchus cepedianus), while accounting for variations in environmental variables, and secondly, the combined relative abundance of mesopredatory sharks detected (spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias; school shark, Galeorhinus galeus; and carpet shark, Cephaloscyllium isabellum).Mesopredators had a higher relative abundance in MRs by a factor of 2.5 and there was a strong significant effect of protection, suggesting that MRs have led to an increase in their abundance or a change in distribution. In contrast, there was no effect of protection detected for sevengill sharks.It is concluded that the relatively small (<40 km(2)) MRs sampled do not provide conservation benefits for a large, mobile shark, but that they are potentially large enough to offer protection for mesopredatory sharks with smaller home ranges.To be effective for shark conservation, we therefore recommend that MRs need to be appropriately sized for the ranging behaviour of the target species for protection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,FEB,2023,33,2,,,,,144,159,,10.1002/aqc.3911,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3911,,DEC 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000904021100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this issue, we conducted a study to identify the different species of sharks and rays in Malaysian waters using DNA barcoding of the CO1 gene, which is akin to DNA fingerprinting for species. We collected 175 individuals between June 2015 and June 2022, randomly selecting up to six specimens from each species. We successfully generated DNA barcodes for 67 species, belonging to 44 genera, 20 families, and 11 orders. Accurate species identification will improve species-specific catch landing data and accelerate the identification of use and illegal trade in Malaysia. The data provided in this article are partial fragments of the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial gene (CO1) sequences of 175 tissues sampled from sharks and batoids collected from Malaysian waters, from June 2015 to June 2022. The barcoding was done randomly for six specimens from each species, so as to authenticate the code. We generated barcodes for 67 different species in 20 families and 11 orders. DNA was extracted from the tissue samples following the Chelex protocols and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the barcoding universal primers FishF2 and FishR2. A total of 654 base pairs (bp) of barcode CO1 gene from 175 samples were sequenced and analysed. The genetic sequences were blasted into the NCBI GenBank and Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD). A review of the blast search confirmed that there were 68 valid species of sharks and batoids that occurred in Malaysian waters. We provided the data of the COI gene mid-point rooting phylogenetic relation trees and analysed the genetic distances among infra-class and order, intra-species, inter-specific, inter-genus, inter-familiar, and inter-order. We confirmed the addition of Squalus edmundsi, Carcharhinus amboinensis, Alopias superciliosus, and Myliobatis hamlyni as new records for Malaysia.

Here, we investigate the distribution of three pseudo -cryptic species formerly lumped in the morphospecies Ammonia tepida (Cushman, 1926), commonly found on estuarine mudflats along the European coasts: Ammonia veneta Schultze, 1854 (T1), Ammonia aberdoveyensis Haynes, 1973 (T2) and Ammonia confertitesta Zheng, 1978 (T6). We studied their distribution at 51 sites located in seven estuaries of the French North Atlantic coast (Elorn, Aulne, Odet, Crac'h, Auray, Vilaine, Vie), using both morphological and molecular identification methods. Ammonia veneta was detected by both approaches at most of the stations. While A. aberdoveyensis was frequently identified by the morphological method but not detected with metabarcoding, the presence of A. confertitesta in the eDNA data often contrasted with its absence in the morphological analysis. The absence of A. aberdoveyensis in eDNA of sites where it was identified morphologically could be the consequence of its relative scarcity, and eventually a patchy distribution. Concerning A. confertitesta, we hypothesise that these contradictory results can be explained by the supposedly invasive character of this species. Despite the widespread presence of A. confertitesta genetic material (including adults, juveniles and propagules), a mature population has not yet fully developed everywhere. The seven investigated estuaries seem to represent different stages of replacement of the autochthonous species A. veneta and A. aberdoveyensis by A. confertitesta.

The complex ecological interactions among pathogens, microbial communities, tree hosts and the environment are important drivers of forest dynamics. Little is known about the ecology of forest pathology and related microbial communities in temperate forests of the southern hemisphere. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to characterize sapwood-inhabiting fungal communities in North Patagonian Nothofagus forests and assessed patterns of diversity of taxa and ecological guilds across climatic, site and host variables (health condition and compartment) as a contribution to Nothofagus autecology. The diversity patterns inferred through the metabarcoding analysis were similar to those obtained through culture-dependent approaches. However, we detected additional heterogeneity and greater richness with culture-free methods. Host species was the strongest driver of fungal community structure and composition, while host health status was the weakest. The relative impacts of site, season, plant compartment and health status were different for each tree species; these differences can be interpreted as a matter of water availability. For Nothofagus dombeyi, which is distributed across a wide range of climatic conditions, site was the strongest driver of community composition. The microbiome of N. pumilio varied more with season and temperature, a relevant factor for forest conservation in the present climate change scenario. Both species carry a number of potential fungal pathogens in their sapwood, whether they exhibit symptoms or not.

A fundamental question in the archaeology of Madagascar is the extent to which arrival of settlers, introduction of non-native plants and animals, and subsequent human exploitation of island biota, which catalyzed declines in biodiversity and significantly degraded environmental conditions. Fine-grained datasets, including zooarchaeological, archaeobotanical and other ecological evidence, are needed to assess the relationship between human resource exploitation and environmental change. On Madagascar, the resolution of zooarchaeological datasets is often reduced by poor preservation of faunal remains, making precise taxonomic identifications difficult, and few projects to-date have comprehensively assessed zooarchaeological data. Here, we present zooarchaeological data from three coastal villages in the Velondriake Marine Protected Area in southwest Madagascar, where human occupation spans from ca. 1400 BP to the present. Faunal remains from the Late Holocene sites of Antsaragnagnangy and Antsaragnasoa were identified using morphological analysis of remains, and a PCR-based bulk bone metabarcoding approach was applied at Andamotibe to molecularly identify fish and other vertebrates in a faunal assemblage that was particularly fragmented. Results were interpreted and contextualized using modern data on local fish diversity, climate and anthropogenic impacts on marine and estuarine habitats, as well as modern fishing practices (including preferred fishing grounds, tackle, taxonomic representation and volume of catch). Our use of multiple analytical and interpretative approaches has provided the most highly resolved view to date of past human subsistence in coastal southwest Madagascar. We contend that future research into human-environment dynamics on Madagascar should make use of diverse analytical methods, in order to more comprehensively evaluate past interactions between human communities and the native biota.

In 2020, four lionfish were recorded on mesophotic reefs of the Amazon offshore Coast and Fernando de Noronha Archipelago. However, until now, there were no records of invasive lionfish in Brazilian nearshore waters or even such a high number of individuals. In this article, we report the continuing invasion process along the Brazilian Province by multiple sightings (72) of lionfish from March to May 2022 in estuaries, seagrass beds, and artificial and natural reefs across 240 km of the Brazilian coast. These are the first records of lionfish in coastal northeast Brazil and the shallowest records (1-16 m) from South Atlantic tropical waters. The largest simultaneous records of lionfish in breakwaters, fishing weirs, and marambaias (artificial reefs used as fishing grounds) on the Brazilian Northeastern coast indicate that these man-made structures are suitable habitats for this species. Most of the lionfish (58%) were recorded in artificial reefs and fishing weirs. Moreover, the detection of invasions in marginal reefs, estuaries, and two marine protected areas characterized by moderately turbid water and high sedimentation rates highlights the adaptability of the lionfish, making it extremely difficult for divers and fishers to capture them. We call for an urgent management plan considering that the invaded tropical region hosts a high level of endemism, and rare and/or cryptic taxa, which increases the risk of impacts since these are primary lionfish prey.",,,,,"de Oliveira Soares, Marcelo/AAW-5624-2020; Tavares, Tallita/AAI-3501-2020; Rocha, Luiz/T-6326-2019; Feitosa, Caroline/KIE-2196-2024; Garcia, Tatiane/GON-5018-2022; Giarrizzo, Tommaso/G-8482-2016; Leite Ferreira, Carlos Eduardo/JVD-6035-2023; Soares, Marcelo de Oliveira/J-3653-2016; Carneiro, Pedro/Q-2439-2018","Tavares, Tallita/0000-0002-4759-3072; Leite Ferreira, Carlos Eduardo/0000-0002-4311-0491; Soares, Marcelo de Oliveira/0000-0002-4696-3166; Rocha, Luiz/0000-0003-4011-569X; de Vasconcelos Silva, Grasielle Dayse/0000-0002-7780-8089; Carneiro, Pedro/0000-0002-4577-3803",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,AUG 1,2022,9,,,,,,,,956848,10.3389/fmars.2022.956848,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.956848,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000841151100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Alpha1 distribution was uniform along the cartilage, increasing in 48 days-old rats (C20). Treated animals anticipated this increase to the age of 36 days (T9). The number of alpha 2-positive cells was increased in C9 in the anterior condylar region, in C9 and C20 in the middle region and showed no differences in the posterior region.

Here, we present the structural analysis of a barge midship section that has decreased up to 36.4% of its deck thickness caused by corrosion. This analysis is developed using finite element method (FEM) models that include the barge and cargo weights, and wave load effects. The FEM models regarded three cargo tanks in the midship section, containing the main longitudinal and transverse structural elements. In addition, the hull girder section modulus and the required deck thickness of the barge were calculated using Lloyd's Register rules. These rules were applied to estimate the permissible bending stresses at deck and bottom plates under sagging and hogging conditions, which agreed well with those of the FEM models. Based on FEM models, the maximum compressive normal stress and von Mises stress of the hull girder structure were 175.54 MPa and 215.53 MPa, respectively. These stress values do not overcome the yield strength (250 MPa) of the barge material, allowing a safe structural behavior of the barge.

Here, a survey of fishes from the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago was barcoded using the COI marker, which allowed the identification of 21 species. This paved the way to further investigate the fish biodiversity of the archipelago, transitioning from barcoding to metabarcoding analysis. As preparatory steps for future metabarcoding studies, the first extensive COI library of fishes listed for these islands was constructed and includes new data generated in this survey as well as previously available data, resulting in a final database with 9,183 sequences from 169 species and 63 families of fish.

This research was conducted in Miscanthus to determine the effects on crop response and soil compaction of annually repeated harvest traffic, applied before shoot emergence but after the initiation of new growth in the rhizome. Three treatments were used; (a) an untrafficked control, (b) trafficking with equipment that simulated the baler harvesting system (baler) and (c) trafficking with equipment that simulated the forager harvesting system (forager). The experiment was conducted on an Umbrisol at the Teagasc Crops Research Centre, Oakpark, Co. Carlow, Ireland in 2009 and repeated in 2010 and 2011. Effects on crop response were determined by measuring stem numbers, stem height, biomass yield and overall stem yield. Effects on soil compaction were assessed by measuring soil penetration resistance, bulk density and water infiltration rate. A comparative analysis was conducted on soil temperature data from sites across northern Europe to determine when growth was likely to begin each year and thus estimate when harvest traffic was likely to cause damage. An analysis of traffic patterns in both the baler and forager harvest systems was also conducted to determine which system was likely to minimise crop damage. Trafficked zone stem yield was significantly lower in 2011 (5.24 tdm ha(-1)) when compared with 2009 (11.17 tdm ha(-1)). Significantly lower stem yield was recorded in the trafficked zones of both the baler (5.98 tdm ha(-1)) and forager (6.01 tdm ha(-1)) treatments when compared with the untrafficked control (13.90 tdm ha(-1)). Soil penetration resistance and bulk density were significantly higher at a depth of 30 cm in 2011 (3.08 MPa and 1.82 g cm(-3), respectively) when compared with 2009 (2.74 MPa and 1.58 g respectively). Water infiltration rate was significantly lower in the baler (0.3 cm h(-1)) and forager (0.9 cm h(-1)) treatments when compared with the control (1.7 cm h(-1)). Across northern Europe the annual Miscanthus harvest should be completed by late March to minimise the risk of damage to new growth by harvest traffic. If delayed harvests are unavoidable, crop damage can be minimised by using the forager system because of its reduced traffic intensity (number of passes) when compared with the baler system.

The model consists of coupling mathematical formulations of CO2 and Cl- diffusion with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Random events were generated using MCS to create several design life and environmental scenarios. A case study was performed by simulating five Brazilian environmental conditions and distinct mixes of concrete. The effect of input parameters on the reinforcement concrete depassivation probability was evaluated. The results point out that the depassivation probability due to carbonation is more significant in urban centers, and the compressive strength of concrete has the main influence on the depassivation probability. Results also showed that the depassivation probability due to chloride ingress is influenced by, in order of importance, the chloride content on the surface (61.4%), concrete cover (20.3%), compressive strength (7.1%), relative humidity (6.1%), and temperature (5.1%). In addition, an increase in the compressive strength of concrete, from 30 to 50 MPa, can reduce depassivation probability by up to 70%, resulting in a concrete structure that attends the durability limit state. Thus, by incorporating probabilistic approaches, this model can be a valuable tool in the civil construction industry for studying the improvement of durability, reliability, and safety of reinforced concrete structures.",,,,,"Carrazedo, Rogerio/K-3573-2013; Possan, Edna/I-7151-2012; Felix, Emerson Felipe/Q-6018-2017","Carrazedo, Rogerio/0000-0003-2750-034X; Possan, Edna/0000-0002-3022-7420; Felix, Emerson Felipe/0000-0002-8928-9474",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2075-5309,,,,APR,2023,13,4,,,,,,,993,10.3390/buildings13040993,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings13040993,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000979363500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Brown boobies breed in all oceans in the tropical region and are common across their range. In Tinhosa Grande (SAo Tome and Principe), this species breeds in one of the largest colonies of seabirds in the east tropical Atlantic. We studied the foraging ecology of Brown boobies from this colony during the chick-rearing period. Thirty-three birds were tracked with GPS loggers and their diet was analysed from 11 regurgitations, using traditional and DNA barcoding techniques for prey identification. A total of 127 completed foraging trips were identified, 89% of which lasted less than 24 h. Females performed significantly longer trips and both sexes foraged preferentially over deep oceanic waters. The diet of Brown boobies included juvenile fish and squid (Sthenoteuthis pteropus), comprising mostly fish species whose juvenile phases live in the pelagic environment, and only migrate to coastal waters when adults. The most frequent of those prey found was Flying gurnard (Dactylopterus volitans). The relevance of such prey shows that Brown booby conservation depends not only on the management of their foraging areas and breeding sites but also on the correct management of the coastal adjacent areas that support the adult individuals of some of their prey. Our results suggest that the areas closest to the colony do not have available resources for these birds to feed on and that Brown boobies may be associate with subsurface marine predators or with sargassum patches to forage.",,,,,"Robalo, Joana/AAG-4817-2021; Correia, Edna/ITU-7994-2023; Lima, Cristina/LFT-8606-2024; Catry, Paulo/I-5408-2013; Robalo, Joana/N-9960-2014; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro/E-8060-2011; Correia, Edna/D-8766-2019","Catry, Paulo/0000-0003-3000-0522; Robalo, Joana/0000-0002-7470-0574; Lima, Cristina/0000-0002-6977-4237; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro/0000-0002-7207-3474; Sinclair, Frazer/0000-0001-5017-3215; Correia, Edna/0000-0003-3893-1700",,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,JUN,2021,168,6,,,,,,,91,10.1007/s00227-021-03904-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-021-03904-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000686889800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, the use of finite raw materials and their impact has led to the search for alternative materials that can be reused in the construction industry. The present study investigated the mechanical properties (bond strength, compressive strength, and flexural strength), durability (water absorption), and microstructural analysis of rendering mortars with different levels of replacement (2.5 wt%, 5 wt%, 7.5 wt%, and 10 wt%) of natural sand by water treatment sludge aggregate. The results were statistically analyzed through mathematical models and analysis of variance. It is evident from this study that the inclusion of sludge increases the porosity of the mortars, which influences all the physical and mechanical properties. The bond strength, which is the main property of the rendering mortar, showed satisfactory values (> 0.2 MPa) for mortars with 5% of water treatment sludge, despite having high variability. Furthermore, the microstructural analysis showed the influence of particle characteristics on the performance of the mortars with water treatment sludge.

Injectable biomaterials offer several advantages relative to implants due to their ability to cure in situ, thus conforming to irregularly shaped defects. While Food and Drug Administration-approved injectable calcium phosphate cements have excellent osteoconductivity and compressive strengths, these materials have small pore sizes (e. g., 1 mu m) and are thus relatively impermeable to cellular infiltration. To overcome this limitation, we aimed to develop injectable allograft bone/polyurethane (PUR) composite bone void fillers with tunable properties that support rapid cellular infiltration and remodeling. The materials comprised particulated (e. g., >100 mu m) allograft bone particles and a biodegradable two-component PUR, and had variable (e. g., 30%-70%) porosities. The injectable void fillers exhibited an initial dynamic viscosity of 220 Pa.s at clinically relevant shear rates (40 s(-1)), wet compressive strengths ranging from <1 to 13 MPa, working times from 3 to 8 min, and setting times from 10 to 20 min, which are comparable to the properties of calcium phosphate bone cements. When injected in femoral plug defects in athymic rats, the composites supported extensive cellular infiltration, allograft resorption, collagen deposition, and new bone formation at 3 weeks. The combination of both initial mechanical properties suitable for weight-bearing applications as well as the ability of the materials to undergo rapid cellular infiltration and remodeling may present potentially compelling opportunities for injectable allograft/PUR composites as biomedical devices for bone regeneration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1937-3341,,,,,AUG,2010,16,8,,,,,2505,2518,,10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0672,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0672,,,,,,,,20218874,,,,,WOS:000280648700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mannitol, CaCl2, MgCl2, and NaCl were used to develop five degrees of osmotic potential: 0, -0.3, -0.6, -0.9 and -1.2 MPa. Van't Hoff's equation was used to calculate the osmotic potential. The protein pattern of the total soluble proteins after electrophoresis was evaluated with SDS-PAGE. The response parameters were evaluated including the germination, the vigour classification, the root dry weight, the shoot dryr weight and the resultant differential protein expression. The experimental design was completely randomised. Data were analysed using the F test (ANOVA), and polynomial regression was used for the osmotic potential levels for each parameter. The protein banding pattern was evaluated using gel imaging. The simulation of a water deficiency resulted in the perception of a stress and a subsequent response to NaCl in all of the parameters that were evaluated.

Results showed that mortars with 50 % RA had a better MCI (91.80 t.CO2/ MPa) for the externally protected environment, considering tensile adhesion strength as the main property. This happened due to better mechanical performance and higher carbon capture related to cement and limestone content in the mortar since these two are responsible for hydroxide presence. However, results showed more considerable primary energy demand and water consumption with the increase in replacement levels. With these results, the research allows the possibility to better plan the working schedule in building constructions and materials decision-making to help improve carbon capture and natural resources application in coating materials.",,,,,"Possan, Edna/I-7151-2012","Possan, Edna/0000-0002-3022-7420; Borges, Pietra/0000-0003-3152-6569",,,,,,,,,,,,,0950-0618,1879-0526,,,,MAR 14,2025,467,,,,,,,,140407,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2025.140407,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2025.140407,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001428357600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These characteristics have encouraged the intense usage of this species, which also includes the reuse of wood processing waste for panel production. Using teak wood waste, this study aims to manufacture and evaluate heat-pressed particleboards at 5 MPa and 100 ??C, by being glued with castor oil-based polyurethane resin at proportions of 10% for the homogeneous boards and 12% for the heterogeneous solutions. Single-layer (homogeneous) boards were compared with three-layer particleboard specimens (heterogeneous) having the finer particles in the outer layers. The basic density, moisture content, modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity in the static bending and perpendicular tensile, water absorption, and thickness swelling after 24 h were evaluated to support this comparative study. All the manufactured particleboards met the standardized requirements of performance, thus being very feasible for usage as non-structural boards. When the two different compositions were analyzed, a considerably better performance of the three-layered particleboards was identified when compared to the homogeneous panels.",,,,,"De Souza, Matheus/ISA-8811-2023; Reis Rodrigues, Felipe/JPA-5735-2023; Aouada, Fauze/C-3989-2012; Sanches, Alex/G-6380-2016; Silveira Bonfim, Kely/AAJ-7959-2020; Christoforo, André/AAH-5941-2019; Almeida De Araujo, Victor/F-7545-2013; Moura Aouada, Marcia Regina de/F-6231-2014; Rocco Lahr, Francisco/C-6718-2012","Reis rodrigues, Felipe/0000-0003-3895-7169; Almeida De Araujo, Victor/0000-0002-2747-4738; Moura Aouada, Marcia Regina de/0000-0002-2534-5553; Viana de Souza, Matheus/0000-0003-1867-3249; Rocco Lahr, Francisco/0000-0002-3510-8498",,,,,,,,,,,,,1930-2126,,,,,AUG,2022,17,3,,,,,5011,5020,,10.15376/biores.17.3.5011-5020,http://dx.doi.org/10.15376/biores.17.3.5011-5020,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000844411400023,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this review, we identify the major threats faced by fish populations alongside recent advances that are helping to address these issues. There are very significant efforts worldwide directed towards ensuring a sustainable future for the world's fishes and fisheries and those who rely on them.

Study design: Forty healthy women exclusively breastfeeding were randomized to receive either ETG-releasing implant 24-48 h after delivery (n=20) or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA group; n=20) at the sixth week postpartum. We measured blood pressure, maternal and neonatal weight, body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)), waist circumference (WC), complete blood count, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), lipid profile, fasting serum glucose and maintenance of exclusive lactation up to the 12th week postpartum. Results: Decreases in mean maternal weight, BMI (kg/m(2)) and WC were significantly greater in the ETG-releasing implant group than in the MPA group during the first 6 weeks postpartum (-4.64 +/- 2.71 kg vs. -2.6 +/- 2.45 kg mean +/- SD, p=.017; -1.77 +/- 1.06 kg/m(2) vs. -0.97 +/- 0.95 kg/m(2), p=.026; -15.3 +/- 6.72 cm vs. -9.05 +/- 5.84 cm, p=.003, respectively). In addition, total cholesterol and HDL, were lower in DMPA users, and TNF-alpha and leukocytes were higher in DMPA users compared to in the implant group, between 6 and 12 weeks after delivery. The newborns of implant users showed a trend towards gaining more weight, as compared with the infants of the DMPA mothers during the first 6 weeks of life (implant group: +1460.50 +/- 621.34 g vs. DMPA group: +1035.0 +/- 562.43 g, p=.05). The remaining variables, including the duration of exclusive breastfeeding, were similar between the groups. Conclusion: The insertion of ETG-releasing contraceptive implant during the immediate postpartum period was not associated with deleterious maternal clinical effects or with significant maternal metabolic alterations or decreased infant weight gain.

This is often difficult to be achieved, especially in Antarctica, due to a variety of logistic constraints, which make continuous sampling and monitoring activities generally unfeasible. Here we focus on the 5 mu m filters used in the desalination plant of the Italian research base Mario Zucchelli in the Terra Nova Bay area (Ross Sea, Antarctica) to evaluate infra-annual coastal nanoplankton dynamics. These filters, together with others of larger mesh sizes, are used to decrease the amount of organisms and debris in the input seawater before the desalination processes take place, hence automatically collect the plankton present in the water column around the desalination system intake. We have used a DNA metabarcoding approach to characterize the communities retained by filters sets collected in January 2012 and 2013. Infra-annual dynamics were disclosed with an unprecedented detail, that would not have been possible by using standard sampling approaches, and highlighted the importance of extreme, stochastic events such as katabatic wind pulses, which triggered dramatic, short-term shifts in coastal nanoplankton composition. This method, by combining a cost-effective sampling and molecular techniques, may represent a viable solution for long-term monitoring programs focusing on Antarctic coastal communities.

Ecological limits, determined by the abiotic conditions and biotic interactions within an environment, are one of the major factors influencing the geographical distribution of species diversity. Energy availability is often considered a crucial limiting factor, with temperature and productivity serving as empirical measures. However, these measures may not fully explain the observed species richness, particularly in marine ecosystems. Here, through a global comparative approach and standardised methodologies, such as Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) and DNA metabarcoding, we show that the seasonality of primary production explains sessile animal richness comparatively or better than surface temperature or primary productivity alone. A Hierarchical Generalised Additive Model (HGAM) is validated, after a model selection procedure, and the prediction error is compared, following a cross-validation approach, with HGAMs including environmental variables commonly used to explain animal richness. Moreover, the linear effect of production magnitude on species richness becomes apparent only when considered jointly with seasonality, and, by identifying world coastal areas characterized by extreme values of both, we postulate that this effect may result in a positive relationship in environments with lower seasonality.",,,,,"Schiaparelli, Stefano/AAI-4024-2020; Ficetola, Gentile/A-2813-2008; Pavloudi, Christina/H-6608-2019; Malachowicz, Magdalena/K-1436-2019; Cecchetto, Matteo/KGL-8310-2024; Balazy, Piotr/D-2949-2018; Fontaneto, Diego/B-9710-2008","Cecchetto, Matteo/0000-0002-4505-4104; Balazy, Piotr/0000-0002-1126-3151; Fontaneto, Diego/0000-0002-5770-0353; Schiaparelli, Stefano/0000-0002-0137-3605; Chelchowski, Maciej/0000-0002-5742-1960; Gallut, Cyril/0000-0002-6486-0179",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-1723,,,,SEP 27,2024,15,1,,,,,,,8340,10.1038/s41467-024-52673-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-52673-z,,,,,,,,39333524,,,,,WOS:001377340000045,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, susceptibility to perturbations and subsequent mortality varies among coral species. In this study, we tested the contribution of genetic and environmental conditions to coral's phenotypic response in Pocillopora spp. and Porites spp. sampled together at a large ecological and temporal scale throughout the Pacific Ocean. We assessed coral phenotype signatures using a multi-biomarker approach (animal and symbiont biomasses, protein carbonylation and ubiquitination and total antioxidant capacities). In both genera, we highlighted a strong anticorrelation between the redox state and the animal and symbiont biomasses. In addition, Pocillopora exhibited high phenotypic plasticity, responding to various environmental variables such as temperature, nutrients, phosphate, and carbonate chemistry. In contrast, Porites displayed more robust phenotypes influenced by both genetics and past climate events. In conclusion, co-located coral species display different phenotypic response strategies that are influenced by different environmental conditions.
