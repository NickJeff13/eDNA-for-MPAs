# Install FuzzyID2 from github: https://github.com/zhangab2008/FuzzyID2.git
# Follow installation instructions in user guide

#### Make a configuration file
# open 'config.txt' (in FuzzyID2 parent directory) in text editor and change lines 3, 4, and 6
# Line 3 - give your local database a unique identifier
# Line 4 - specify the gene used
# Line 6 - input the filepath to the reference library
# Save as unique configuration filename in FuzzyID2 directory eg ESI16S


## Make a database from the reference barcode library. The libraries provided are already formatted for use in FuzzyID2.
cd path_to_FuzzyID2
python3 FuzzyID2_makeDB.py
#input configuration filename when prompted

## Calculate the genetic distances between the query and reference sequences
#d=database name, -in=path to representative seqs.fasta and out=outfile.csv
./FuzzyID2_x86_64 -c ID -m K2P -d Fish_12S -in /mnt/sda2/eDNA/Musquash/Data/12S/dada2out_12S/Musquash-12S-ASV-fasta.fasta -out /mnt/sda2/eDNA/Musquash/Data/12S/dada2out_12S/12STaxonomy_FuzzyID2_GenDistOut.csv



## Assign taxonomy to ASVs, interpretation of the output file
## FuzzyID2 will assign a fuzzy membership function value to the nearest neighbour barcode from the reference database with the smallest genetic distance to the query sequence. 
# When there are multiple reference database sequences with small genetic distances defined from the HMM rough assignment, these will show up as multiple hits to the same ASV in the output file. 
# We assign taxonomy to an ASV when the Fuzzy Membership Function is greater than 0.90. 
# If there are multiple hits to one ASV, sometimes one hit will have an FMF > 0.90 and sometimes all hits will have an FMF of 0. Assign taxonomy where FMF > 0.90. 
# Open csv file in excel, column A is ASV identifier from qiime2, columns B - D are the taxonomic lineage. Column E is the FMF value.


# My step by step guide to processing the FuzzyID2 csv file
# 1. There is one or more entry per ASV, they will be in the same order as the biom feature table. Keep this order as it will allow you to copy and paste taxonomic identity into the biom feature table that was exported. 
# 2. Identify all ASVs with multiple hits (will look like blank lines in Column A, these are multiple hits to the ASV immediately preceding a run of blank cells). Delete all hits except for one, copying the ASV identifier if needed. Order of deletion: FMF < 0.90. If all are less than 0.90, keep one as a placeholder for that ASV to merge to the biom feature table. 
# There should never be two assignments with FMF > 0.90 for the same ASV.
# 3. The sheet should have the same number of ASVs as the feature table and they should be in the same order, check this before merging.
# 4. Copy and paste Columns A to E into the biom feature table.
# 5. Check to see if ASV identifiers line up. If so, delete one column of identifiers.
# 6. Sort the feature table by FMF value, delete the assignments with FMF < 0.90 (first save a copy of the original file for future reference).
# 7. Delete the assignments saying 'The query sequence is too far from the dataset!' (these are not fish and can be blasted for tax ID).
# 8. Depending on the downstream analyses, collapse reads from ASVs assigned to the same species.
